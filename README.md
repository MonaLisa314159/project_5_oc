# project_5_oc
This project consists of a Flask application, which uses a tag prediction model. 
The objective of this project is to set up a system that generates tag suggestions when entering questions (Stackoverflow questions).

Yous can find the API script (application.py) in this repository, the bert model (fine tuned) and tokenizer.
Packages needed to execute the script in requirements.txt
For unit testing, I use Pytest (test_app.py)
